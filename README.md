# Easy-Downloads-Dont-wake-up-just-to-download.
This Project is for the ones who just wake up to start the downloads as it doesn't automatic download (at least for free). So what my script does it that, once you edit them with the wifi you use and add them in the windows task scheduler. It automatic connects you to the wifi at the desired time and starts your download.
